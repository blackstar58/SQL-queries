Profile / Presence Feature Parity

1. Profile Plus
    - Profile Plus should only be sent to O&O 
    - Should not go out to publisher network
2. Presence 
    - Expanded into publisher network
    - CTN enabled
3. FM 18 - Does Advertiser have to be admin of page
         - Does yp require any confirmation
4. FM 21 - No Ads on BP
5. FM 27 - Is this paid placement , is this currently beind done


BR Review - 

BR 1 - No product dependencies (Assumption: This can be purchased without other product , more details required)

BR 2 - There an upgrade path for advertiser
     - What is the value add for a ypLocal advertiser adding presence , in your matrix the ypLocal Ads have all the features of presence
     
Workflow - 
    - SAME CTN's should be used to represent the same locations of the same businesses (Question: Does this mean that the advertiser can have multiple CTN for different location?)
    - How is MLP product impacted since they have different locations with different numbers
    - (Advertiser may opt-out of CTN) - Does this reduce the cost of the product or is the more inline with not using a functionality
    - Can the Advertiser use their own CTN?
    - Can the Advertiser opt-out of using their CTN on the YP publisher network?(I know they can opt-out of yext)
    - Can Advertiser keep multi-CTN model during renewal or are they switched to using one CTN
    - Is CTN now at the Advertiser Level instead of the product level
    - Does Advertiser have apporval of CTN number? Can they reject?

Matrix:

Adverister with nothing - 2 CTN's provided by default: 1 for organic Presence+, and 1 for paid ypLocalAds
    - This break covention you specified above can you provide insight.
    - For paid listing does ypLocal trump other products?

ypPresence Plus 
    - Keep Presence CTN, if Advertiser did not opt-out
    - Use same CTN for ypLocalAds Note: ypLA Local Ad Network sites 

ypLocal Ads - 

    - Keep ypLocalAds CTN for ypLocalAds
    - Add new organic CTN for Profile Plus and Presence Plus
        - Can opt out of distributing CTN's on Yext network
        - Note: ypLA Local Ad Network sites would distribute CTN's, if ypLA has CTN's
            - ***- This will cause issues where two different number will display between organic and paid ad

Business Requirement (MVP)
BR# 2 -    
      -  mobile should default to "call now"
      - *** - Assuming the default CTN will be used - ***

BR# 3 - Custom Slogan
    
    - "Extra Line 50" takes priority over "additional text," which takes priority over "slogan." - Slogan
    - I am assuming the character limits are identical for each field
    - Is the required for ypLocal Ads?
    - Are publisher expected to follow the priority?
    - "Extra Line 50" - This is not be widely used by our publisher 
    - They are using slogan

BR# 4 - 
    - Should user upload image take priority to publisher network
    - Is photos sent in an ordered list to publisher

BR# 18- How are CTN handled for a bronze listing
     - Are there any changes
    
    
    
    
    Call to Action:
    1. Custom Message plus a button
    2. Call now cannot be used 
     - Call to Action - Enable into API 
    3. Add BRD in publisher API
